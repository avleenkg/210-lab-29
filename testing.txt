I think I have been practicing unit testing for a while now. For example, I was having a lot of trouble trying to find a good level of difficulty for my program because some functions were become too complex. So in order to keep myself in check and make sure my code was running properly, I called the function in main and in the function itself, if the function ran properly, it would output something along the lines of "data read in" (example of dataread function). This was super helpful because it helped weed out many small bugs and errors that I had made. For example, my function was outputting "file not found" and I was confused to why my program wasn't working. But I quickly realized that I hidden moved the txt file into the directory to upload it into my scode folder.
